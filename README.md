# Eric's To-Do List: A Rails App

A relatively simple but fully functional to-do list app built with Ruby on Rails 5.2.3, Postgresql, Bootstrap 4.3.1, and Font Awesome 5.9.

To get working, you'll need to have Ruby, Bundler and Postgres installed on your machine. In your terminal `bundle install` everything and run `rails db:migrate`. Then `rails s` to launch the web server, and navigate in your internet browser to `http://localhost:3000`.
